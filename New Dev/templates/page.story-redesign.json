I had learned about the negative impact of refined sugar and wanted to cut it out of my diet. \n\nI wondered, what if there was a way to satisfy my sugar cravings with something healthy and delicious? \n\nI loved baking, so I started making healthy versions of my favourite desserts. One of these was a chocolatey, nutty and sweet snack, known as an energy bite. \nAnytime I craved something sweet, I reached for these energy bites. They completely satisfied my desire. Eliminating refined sugars became easy with these by my side. I had more energy, more clarity, and slept better. I was much happier.","middle-text2":"I spent the summer months that year on the Moose Cree Indigenous Reserve in Northern Ontario. I tried my best to eat healthy, but food insecurity was, and still is an issue.","middle-text3":"When I came home, I started falling back into my old ways of eating candy and chocolate bars. So, I mixed up a batch of these bites, and took them to my family’s home to try.","middle-text4":"My mom loved them so much that she suggested I start selling them. My brother helped come up with the name “nomz”, and a month later, local retailers started carrying it in their stores.","image-middle1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/story_middle.jpg","image-middle2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2022-02-28_at_10.40.32_PM.png","grant-head":"Giving Back","grant-text1":"My time with the Moose Cree Indigenous community transformed me.
